## Design

### Design Considerations

Design Considerations Summary

### Colour

![image color pallette](docs/images/palette.png)

Why the colours were chosen 

The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Fonts

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

+ Font 1 plus description 
+ Font 2 plus description 

### Imagery

Where and why the images

### Structure

The page is structured in a well know, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the restaurant logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right. 
The website consists of four separate pages: 
+ A homepage with reviews, media, product description and a purchase the game call to action sections.
+ A store page where potential players can buy yhe game and it's DLC.
+ A image gallery with images showcasing the general feel of the game through concept art and gameplay screenshots.
+ A signup page with a signup form, a map and information about how to contact the business.

Additionally there is a 404 page included that will return the website user to the home page.

### Wireframes

## Features
The website is comprised of five pages, four of which are accessible from the navigation menu (index/home page, store page, gallery page and the sign up (Join the Posse!) page). The fifth page is a 404 page which which will return the user to th ehome page should they click on an expired link within the site.

+ All Pages on the website have:

+ 404.html

  + Leverages the github pages jekyll engine to provide a custom 404 experience for users and return users back to the site if they end up in a non-existent child domain.
    + Styling here is inline as any http calls to child directories cannot be reliably referneced by links in the header, specifically users could manually input non-existing child directories into the url bar and would not see the styling.
    + Similarly the link back to the home page needs to directly reference the home url [https://bovinehero.com/vm-order-generator/index.html](https://bovinehero.com/vm-order-generator/index.html) as relative referencing will not guarantee a return to the home page if non-existent child directories are inputted into the url.

### Future Implementations

+ Future Implementation 1
+ Future Implementation 2
+ Future Implementation 3

### Accessibility Features
I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

+ Using semantic HTML.
+ Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
+ Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
+ Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
+ Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
